<p> Two teams line up opposite of each other, with one team initiating a "pull" (similar to a kickoff in football). Once the team reieves the disc, they must pass downfield to the endzone to attempt to score a point. Players cannot move with the frisbee, and have to advance up field by passing it amonst each other. Once caught, players can use a foot to pivot to create space. On defense, players are allowed to swat, deflect, and intercept any frisbee, so long as they don't touch it before it leaves an offensive players hand. Once a pass is incomplete in any way (either by means of personal error or defesnive fortitude) the possession is flipped to the other team. </p>
